Hello, I'm new to the GitHub and I've been asked by the support mail to make a little list of the spanish errors. 

Here's the list:


1. Comportamiento en los foros:  Number 3, the use of the words envez is incorrect, they need to be divided in "en vez". http://gyazo.com/20b24b0a7b3cd5bfb4576ceefde3f935

2. Mumble: Number 2, missing letter, correct term: Tu nombre en mumble debe de ser... 
http://gyazo.com/927ab2b22cc24c7c284d317bf9eadceb

3. Jugabilidad general: Number 2 second line, double usage of the word P in Prolongar. http://gyazo.com/6ddce5fffd6114f6b75527dc7d218cdc

4. Jugabilidad general: Number 5, the sentence starts with o, you can change it to No ataques... http://gyazo.com/9cd716ee656c7b64b4267286a1a6b183

5. Jugabilidad general: Number 5, there is a place were it says (Tendrás que modificar tu cañon si esta). There is an error with esta, it should be : está.

6. Infracciones: Number 5, almost at the end of the first line says a, the correct usage of the term is ha, of hacer, which means (make) http://gyazo.com/a2fceb69ba55c30fa70db7e0d771f144

Probably that's all, I asked if my corrections were "correct" and they were, hope to see it soon on oc.tc/revisions/rules :3. Thanks for reading! You could also ask for a Spanish mod or no, I'm not incorrect with any of the traductions above.
