            %ol
                %li Do not make topics or posts aiming to insult or provoke other people or groups, and do not promote or encourage others to make such posts.
                %li Do not make posts that mock or "predict" inflammatory comments, as they encourage users to make such comments.
                %li Do not reply to topics with irrelevant, meaningless, or spammy text/images.
                %li Do not "bump" topics by posting something that does not contribute constructively to the topic.
                %li All personal issues must be dealt with in private. The public forums are not the place for personal conflicts.
                %li Criticism of the work of others, both staff and the larger community, must be delivered with politeness and personal respect.
                %li Do not make topics just to announce that you are quitting the game or the server. Exceptions may be made if you are quitting for a very interesting reason, like you are dying, or sailing around the world.
                %li Announcements about dramatic events befalling yourself or others must include a verifiable source for the information. If we cannot easily verify the story, the topic may be removed. Deliberate hoaxes of this nature are considered very serious infractions.
                %li Do not reply to a topic that you feel is violating the rules, submit a report instead. Intentionally lying in a report is considered an infraction.
                %li Do not abuse HTML in the forums or personal profiles in a way that makes navigation difficult, causes extreme browser lag, or exceeds the preset boundaries.
                %span.label.label-warning Note

                %li Please do not publicly accuse any players of hacking. If you believe a player is hacking or breaking any rules report them using the /report command.
