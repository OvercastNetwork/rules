                header: A. General Composure
                rules:
                - Maintain a pleasant, casual atmosphere. Be respectful and use common sense. Excessive swearing, rudeness and harassment is not tolerated.
                - Try to maintain proper spelling and grammar.
                - Do not spam.
                - 'Do not link to any of the following:'
                -
                    list:
                    - 'Objectionable material, which includes but is not limited to pornography, "shock sites", viruses, phishing sites and hate groups.'
                    - Other websites or servers in a manner that constitutes advertising.
                    - Personal identifying information of other users.
                - Do not encourage or partake in rule breaking on Overcast Network services.
                - Do not impersonate any member of the Overcast Network staff, or claim to be a staff member.
                - Report issues or bugs of Overcast Network services to either the forums or to support@oc.tc; exploitation of bugs for any reason other than to demonstrate at the request of a staff member will result in a punishment.
                - Follow any directions given by a Overcast Network staff member. If you believe a staff member has directed you wrongly, please email support@oc.tc.
                notes:
                - If you are concerned about links that may constitute advertising, please clarify with a staff member before posting.
            -
                header: B. Website Behavior
                rules:
                - Do not make topics or posts aiming to insult or provoke other people or groups, and do not promote or encourage others to make such posts.
                - 'Do not make posts that mock or "predict" inflammatory comments, as they encourage users to make such comments.'
                - Do not reply to topics with irrelevant, meaningless, or spammy text/images.
                - 'Do not "bump" topics by posting something that does not contribute constructively to the topic.'
                - All personal issues must be dealt with in private. The public forums are not the place for personal conflicts.
                - Criticism of the work of others, both staff and the larger community, must be delivered with politeness and personal respect.
                - Do not make topics just to announce that you are quitting the game or the server. Exceptions may be made if you are quitting for a very interesting reason, like you are dying, or sailing around the world.
                - Announcements about dramatic events befalling yourself or others must include a verifiable source for the information. If we cannot easily verify the story, the topic may be removed. Deliberate hoaxes of this nature are considered very serious infractions.
                - Do not reply to a topic that you feel is violating the rules, submit a report instead. Intentionally lying in a report is considered an infraction.
                - Do not abuse HTML in the forums or personal profiles in a way that makes navigation difficult, causes extreme browser lag, or exceeds the preset boundaries.
                notes:
                - Your profile or contact information may be wiped without notice.
            -

                - Do not impersonate other players on Mumble.
                - Your Mumble name should be your in-game name or some easily identified variation.
                - Do not spam actions that send messages to others (such as spamming mute, deafen or disconnecting and reconnecting repeatedly)
            -
                header: D. Server Behavior
                rules:
                - Do not send messages that encourage other players into leaving a team or disconnecting from the server.
                - Unless you are explaining the report process, you may not encourage others to report a specific player.
                - Please do not publicly accuse any players of hacking. If you believe a player is hacking or breaking any rules report them using the /report command.
                - You may not use any form of in game chat to solicit. Any account that is determined to be for the sole use of soliciting will be permanently banned without warning.
                - You may not link to, or solicit players to join, any server public or private that is not part of the Overcast Network in public chat. (You may use the /msg command to inform players that request it).
                - Your username must be appropriate, and you may be asked to use a different account if your username is found to be inappropriate. (This does not count as ban evasion.)
                - If you have access to the /nick command, any chosen nickname should be designed to confer anonymity, not attention. You may not use /nick to impersonate others, and you may not use an inappropriate nickname.

                - All chat messages and commands are logged.
