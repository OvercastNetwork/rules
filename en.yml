                note1: If you are concerned about links that may constitute advertising, please clarify with a staff member before posting.
            -
                header: B. Website Behavior
                a: Do not make topics or posts aiming to insult or provoke other people or groups, and do not promote or encourage others to make such posts.
                b: 'Do not make posts that mock or "predict" inflammatory comments, as they encourage users to make such comments.'
                c: Do not reply to topics with irrelevant, meaningless, or spammy text/images.
                d: 'Do not "bump" topics by posting something that does not contribute constructively to the topic.'

                g: Do not make topics just to announce that you are quitting the game or the server. Exceptions may be made if you are quitting for a very interesting reason, like you are dying, or sailing around the world.
                h: Announcements about dramatic events befalling other players must include a verifiable source for the information. If we cannot easily verify the story, the topic may be removed. Deliberate hoaxes of this nature are considered very serious infractions.

                    html: 'Do not reply to a topic that you feel is violating the rules, %{href} instead. Intentionally lying in a report is considered an infraction.'

            -
                header: D. Server Behavior

                e: You may not link to, or solicit players to join, any server public or private that is not part of the Overcast Network in public chat. (You may use /msg command to inform players that request it).
                f: Your username must be appropriate, and you may be asked to use a different account if your username is found to be inappropriate. (This does not count as ban evasion.)
